## EQ Home Teaching Bot
Automated Home Teaching Reports

This is a simple bot for collecting [home teaching](https://www.lds.org/topics/home-teaching?lang=eng&old=true) reports from your quorum members. It does this by sending and responding to **text messages sent with the [Twilio](http://twilio.com) API.**

The app itself is built with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. We use Docker and Docker Compose to make it easy to get up and running anywhere.

---

## Requirements

To get this running, here's what you'll need.

- A [Twilio Account](http://twilio.com)
	- You can use the free option, but they'll prepend a bit of placeholder text to your SMS messages.
	- Make a note of your **Account SID** and **Auth Token** on the [Twilio Console](https://www.twilio.com/console), you'll need them later.
	- Finally, set up a new **Messaging Service** under the **Programmable SMS** section. Note the `SID` of the service once it's created, you'll also need it later.
- An [LDS Account](http://lds.org) with access rights to [Home Teaching data](http://lds.org/htvt/)
	- E.g., You'll have to be in the Elders Quorum or have another leadership calling.
- [Node](nodejs.org) version >= 6.8
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) or NPM
- [`ngrok`](https://ngrok.com/) for forwarding Twilio API requests to your local machine while testing
- [Docker](https://docker.com) for running the app
	- [Docker for Mac](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/)
	- [Docker for Windows](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/)

## Setup Instructions

First, clone the repository down and jump inside:

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:hamstu/eq-reporting.git
$ cd eq-reporting
```

Now we'll install the local dependencies:

```bash
$ yarn
```

Or if you're using `npm` instead:

```bash
$ npm install
```

Now open the `example.env` file in the project's root folder.

Update the fields to match the ones you noted earlier.
You can leave the `MONGO_*` and `NODE_*` variables alone, the defaults should be fine.

```bash
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=123321441241941819409414
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=47812fe12fe18fd118118d1fd
TWILIO_MESSAGING_SERVICE_ID=abcd123
LDS_ACCOUNT_USERNAME=MyUserName
LDS_ACCOUNT_PASSWORD=password
MONGO_HOST=mongodb://mongo
MONGO_PORT=27017
MONGO_DB=eqreporting
NODE_PORT=8000
ADMIN_USER=admin
ADMIN_PASSWORD=password
```

Rename the file to `.env`. (`.env` is already in the `.gitignore` and so will not be commited to any repository.)

### Scrape Data

Before we can use the app, we need to scrape the necessary member and companionship data from LDS.org. We run this command on your local system ‚Äì not inside the Docker container like the commands you'll see later ‚Äì because the scraping process usues an invisible browser to simulate an actual login to your LDS account.

```bash
$ npm run scrape
```

If it completes with no errors you should now have two files ‚Äì `companionship.json` and `members.json` ‚Äì in the `scraped` directory.

> Note: You'll have to run the `scrape` command anytime the companionship or member data changes on LDS.org (e.g., you change a home teaching route or assignment.)


### Start The App

Let's start everything up with `docker-compose`.

```bash
$ docker-compose up -d
```

If that worked you should see the app and database containers running with `docker-compose ps`.

```bash
 $ docker-compose ps
       Name                     Command             State            Ports
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
eqreporting_mongo_1   docker-entrypoint.sh mongod   Up      0.0.0.0:27017->27017/tcp
eqreporting_web_1     npm run serve                 Up      0.0.0.0:8000->8000/tcp
```

### Import Scraped Data

With the database runnning inside the Docker container, we can now import the data we scraped earlier.

```bash
$ docker-compose exec web npm run import
```

You'll see something like this:

```bash
> eq-reporting@1.0.0 import /app
> node importer.js

John Smith +15552225454
Jane Doe +15552225454
[...]
```

Now we've got our server running and all the necessary data imported!

### Validating numbers

Since not all members will have cell numbers, you can run the `check-numbers.js` script to validate the numbers as cell phones with Twilio's API. This does cost a small amount per number, so if you'd prefer to do it manually that's also an option.

#### Automated

```bash
$ docker-compose exec web npm run check-numbers
```

#### Manually

For now you'll have to manually edit the MongoDB database to set the `numberType` field for each member to be `'mobile'`. Soon I'll have a bulk way to do this, and eventually I'll add a way to ignore this check entirely and send text messages regardless.

### Send and Receive a Message

Now let's actually do something with this bot! ü§ñ To test it out you'll want to make it publically available (i.e., to the internet). We _could_ just deploy it to a server pretty that supports Docker, but an even quicker way to test is with [`ngrok`](https://ngrok.com/).

Install `ngrok`, and then run this command in a separate console window, so that the express server is still running.

```bash
$ ngrok http <PORT>   # replace <PORT> here with the NODE_PORT in your `.env` file
```

You should see some output that includes:

```
Forwarding                    http://6f5cd49f.ngrok.io -> localhost:8000
```

That URL is available to anyone now and will point directly to the app/server running on your computer! (Cool, eh?)

Now copy the ngrok URL `http://6f5cd49f.ngrok.io` (yours will be different) and paste it into your Twilio Messaging Service's **Inbound and Outbound Settings** sections as follows:

	Request URL:         http://6f5cd49f.ngrok.io/receive
	Status Callback URL: http://6f5cd49f.ngrok.io/status

Save the Messaging Service once you've done that.

‚≠êÔ∏è Now send a text message to your Messaging Service's number. If all works well, it should hit the server, look you up your phone number in the ward directory, and reply with a simple response! Try asking for your Home Teaching route by texting the message `route` to the bot.

### Troubleshooting

If you're not getting a text message in response, it might help to check the log output from the server.

```bash
$ docker-compose logs -f web
```

Running that command will give you a live feed of any logs from the server, and will let you know if there are any errors occuring.

### Deploying to Production

Coming soon.
